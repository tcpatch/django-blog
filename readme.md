# Django Blog

## Overview

This is a template blog at a work in progress commit of a blog I put together. The css design is for mobile viewing so does not render nicely on a computer.

## To Run

running Python 3.8.10:

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

`python manage.py runserver`

view on local host

Note: Can create users (or just a super user `python manage.py createsuperuser` https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.2/intro/tutorial02/#c-content-5-unix) to login. This will allow new posts to be made. Make a user with name authUser1 or authUser2 to access editing/private posts.
